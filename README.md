# Blogster

Theme: **bubblegum**

Blogster is a collection of beautiful, accessible and performant blog templates built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev).

Check out the demo here - [Blogster bubblegum template](https://blogster-bubblegum.netlify.app).

## Features

- **Modern UI**. A clean, readable interface with dark/light mode support.
- **MDX support**. Write components directly in your content.
- **SEO ready**. Full Open Graph and Twitter Cards support.
- **Fast**. 100/100 Lighthouse performance score.
- **Mobile-friendly**. Responsive design that works on all devices.

## How do I add content?

All the content is written in markdown (.md) and grouped as `blog` or `projects` in the `content` directory. All the default markdown syntax will work. You also have a few example custom markdown elements like _YouTube embed_, _Twitter embed_, etc. You can create your own custom components too in two easy steps.

1. Add a markdoc config. Check out the markdoc config in [src/lib/markdoc/config.ts](src/lib/markdoc/config.ts) to learn how to add custom components.
2. Add a component to render your custom component. Check out the Renderer in [src/components/Renderer.astro](src/components/Renderer.astro).

## How do I make it my blog?

Easy.

- All content is static and everything is straight forward. Change whatever you need to change.
- Delete or update the content in `content/{content-group}`. `content-group` could be `blog`, `projects` or `anything`.
- (Optional) If you need more content types like _Notes_, just create a new dir in `content` and add a new frontmatter validator like [src/lib/markdoc/blog/frontmatter](src/lib/markdoc/blog/frontmatter).

## How do I deploy?

`yarn build` will generate a static website in `dist` dir. You can host it with any static hosting. If you need a recommendation, check out [Netlify](netlify.com).
